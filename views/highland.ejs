    <p>People who settled the mountains and hills. Due to the difficulty of taking the high ground, Spanish conquistadors and missionaries found little success in ruling or influencing highland communities. Highlanders used simple tools; their
      livelihoods mainly depended on hunting and gathering, bolstered by agriculture. Some highland dwellers traded among themselves and lowland dwellers, while some preferred isolation. Under the American and Philippine governments, they were able
      to stay in their homes and keep their culture. However, most highland communities are dying out along with their practices, or are intermingling into the larger Filipino population.</p>

      <p>The Aeta, also known as the Agta or Ati, are aborigines believed to have been one of the first to settle the Philippines over 30,000 years ago. The Spanish called them Negritos because of their dark skin and short stature. They lived
        scattered among the mountains of Luzon and were nomadic. The Aeta organized themselves in decentralized tribes and used iron tools. Some Aeta groups believe in one supreme deity called Apo Na who ruled over lesser spirits while some believe
        in four manifestations of the great creator.</p>
