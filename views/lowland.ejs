    <p>People who have settled the coast, plains, and river banks. Lowlanders are more well-known and wide-spread than their highland counterparts. They armed themselves with iron weapons along with wooden side-arms such as throwing spears and
      shields and preferred wearing light to no armor. They were also known to use swivel-mounted and hand-held versions of cannons called <span class="italicized">lantaka</span>. They engaged in trade and waged war with each other and other surrounding thalassocracies. The
      majority of the lowlanders eventually either allied with the Spanish or were conquered. Descendants of lowland dwellers have, for the most part, adapted to the changes of time and, aside from the most destitute, can live relatively modern
      lives.</p>

      <p>The Ilocanos are the 3rd largest Filipino ethnolinguistic group. Ilocano loosely translated to "from the bay." They initially settled Ilocos Norte, but can now be found in modern-day Cagayan Valley and Cordillera in Northern Luzon, and
        parts of Central Luzon. The Ilocanos are believed to be distant descendants of Taiwanese settlers. They were animists and believed in spirits called anitos. Their creation story revolves around a primordial giant named Angalo, who was also
        the first man and the son of a god. They speak Ilocano and once had a writing system called Kuri-tan.</p>

      <h2>Cebuano</h2>
      <p>The kingdom of Cebu was founded by Sri Lumay, also known as Rajah Lumaya, of the Sumatran Chola Dynasty during the 13th Century. He and his descendants settled islands throughout Visayas and often warred against Muslim raiders. Under the
        rule of his grandson, Rajah Humabon, the Cebuanos enjoyed a prosperous life with the capital Sibo (meaning trade center) controlling major trade routes. They used a writing form called Kudlit-Badlit, speak Cebuano, and are considered Sugbu Visayans.
        Cebuanos were the first people to ally with the Spanish in exchange for dealing with Humabon's rival, Datu Lapu Lapu, from the neighboring island of Mactan. When Magellan's men failed, the Cebuanos drove off the remaining Spanish forces and
        would be hostile upon their return twenty years later.</p>
