    <h1 class="pageTitle">Lowlands</h1>
    <p>People who have settled the coast, plains, and river banks. Lowlanders are more well-known and wide-spread than their highland counterparts. They armed themselves with iron weapons along with wooden side-arms such as throwing spears and
      shields and preferred wearing light to no armor. They were also known to use swivel-mounted and hand-held versions of cannons called lantaka. They engaged in trade and waged war with each other and other surrounding thalassocracies. The
      majority of the lowlanders eventually either allied with the Spanish or were conquered. Descendants of lowland dwellers have, for the most part, adapted to the changes of time and, aside from the most destitute, can live relatively modern
      lives.</p>

        parts of Central Luzon. The Ilocanos are believed to be distant descendants of Taiwanese settlers. They were animists and believed in spirits called anitos. Their creation story revolves around a primordial giant named Angalo, who was also
        the first man and the son of a god. They speak Ilocano and once had a writing system called Kuri-tan.</p>

      <h2>Cebuano</h2>
      <p>The kingdom of Cebu was founded by Sri Lumay, also known as Rajah Lumaya, of the Sumatran Chola Dynasty during the 13th Century. He and his descendants settled islands throughout Visayas and often warred against Muslim raiders. Under the
        rule of his grandson, Rajah Humabon, the Cebuanos enjoyed a prosperous life with the capital Sibo (meaning trade center) controlling major trade routes. They used a writing form called Kudlit-Badlit, and are considered Sugbu Visayans.
        Cebuanos were the first people to ally with the Spanish in exchange for dealing with Humabon's rival, Datu Lapu Lapu, from the neighboring island of Mactan. When Magellan's men failed, the Cebuanos drove off the remaining Spanish forces and
        would be hostile upon their return twenty years later.</p>

      <p>The Waray were Madja-As Visayans. They spoke Waray-Waray and were separate tribes with no centralized power. They settled on the islands of Leyte and Samar. The Waray were pirates, attacking fellow Warays, neighboring thalassocracies, and
        sometimes even Chinese ships. They often took prisoners into indentured slavery working farms or joining raiding parties. When Magellan first arrived on the archipelago, the first island he saw was off the coast of Samar and the Waray were
        the first people he encountered. They were one of the first natives to convert to Christianity though they kept parts of their animistic traditions.</p>

      <p>The Tausug called themselves people of the river. They lived in communities called banwa and were led by spiritual leaders called panglima. Though united by a common language, each banwa was independent. In 1380 Karimul Makhdun arrived in
        the Sulu archipelago, introducing Islam to the Philippine islands. By 1450, the Tausug people united and became a Sultanate though they retained some of their animist beliefs. They, along with their Muslim allies, waged war against the
        Spanish, stymieing their colonization of Mindanao. Today, the Tausug are also found in Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
